With warm regards, 29 th September 2023 Ishan Patro President Indian Academy of Neurosciences ","Message to the Indian Academy of Neurosciences on the Occasion of the International Conference: Brain: Chemistry to Cognition I take the opportunity to congratulate the Academy for choosing such an important, currently relevant subject for the International Conference. I deeply regret my inability to be personality participating in this academic feast. However, I wish to share with you some historical vignettes on the subject through this message. The use of drugs - Chemical or plant derived- to affect conscious state in humans goes back almost to the origin of humanity. The pollens of eight medicinal plants were deposited in a 60,000 years old tomb in Iraq. Opium poppies and cannabis were mentioned in prehistoric documents. Alcohol use has been mentioned in both the Old and New Testament. It was used by Bacchus community in ancient Greece. In respect to India, as far as the recorded history goes, the earliest instances of rational medical knowledge are found in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda, both of the second millennium B.C. Archaeological excavations of the third century. These indicate a high level of knowledge of physical and chemical sciences, likely to be matched by a similar knowledge of medicinal plants and drugs derived thereof. Coming to more recent times it was not till 1897, when Sherrington described the synapse that the role of chemicals in the functioning of the nervous system stimulated research in this field. It was John Langley, a contemporary of Sherrington who provided evidence that at most synapses signaling between neurons was chemical in nature. However, Langley’s studies were restricted to peripheral and autonomic nervous system. Around the same time Adrian, Eccles and others were investigating the role of electrical activity at the synapses. The intense debate about the role of chemical or electrical activity in inter-neuronal transmission continued till 1920 when experiments carried out by Otto Loewi and Henry Dale established the primary role of chemical transmission as against the proposed electrical theory. This was further confirmed a few years later by the work of Julius Axelrod and Raymond Ahlquist. With advances in research methodologies like intracellular recording, microiontophoresis on single cells, fluorometric techniques for measuring the neurotransmitters, Arvid Carlsson a pharmacologist from Sweden, established the role of chemical neurotransmitters in the central nervous systems around 1950s. Interestingly he and his colleagues used reserpine to study its effect on cerebral catecholamines. As you know reserpine a derivative of Rauwolfia Serpentina has been the subject of Pioneering studies by Col. RN Chopra, Prof. BB Bhatia and a host of their pharmacological colleagues and Dr. Rustom JL Vakil in India established its therapeutic use as an antihypertensive and a sedative the first such drug for treatment of these two clinical conditions. The work on Serpasil in USA and Sweden was triggered by these Indians studies (Tandon 2021). After persistent efforts Carlsson along with a number of his Swedish Colleagues - Chemists and pharmacologist - established the methodology to localize dopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonin in the brain. This ultimately led to the use of L-DOPA as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease and laid the foundation of the role of chemicals in cognitive activity disorders. The last couple of decades following the advent of non-invasive neuroimaging and other investigations have witnessed an explosion of development of the cognitive science. This is further enhanced by study of cognitive functions in healthy volunteers. I am sure the multifaceted contribution of the participants of this International Conference would add to the development of this field. I once again congratulate the organizers of this conference, specially its President Prof. Ishan Patro and his team to collect such distinguished investigators. P.N.
